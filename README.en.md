As mentioned in the introduction, this is a real-time video streaming tool **based on modern Web technologies (e.g. WebRTC)**.

- With TURN/STUN servers configured, it allows users to **share local videos (or online video streams) with any other user on the Internet**, without worrying about cross-platform, cross-device, or cross-network issues.
- Due to its working principle, users do not need to register or log in, and video stream data will not be stored on the server because it is a **peer-to-peer** application.
- In the future, more features will be added, such as **screen sharing, real-time chat**, etc.

## Deployment

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/kev1nweng/reel-sync&env=VITE_NODE_SERVER_URL&env=VITE_MAX_ACCEPTABLE_DELAY_SECONDS&project-name=reel-sync&repository-name=reel-sync)⠀←⠀Click this button to deploy on Vercel (recommended), **or:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kev1nweng/reel-sync && cd reel-sync && npm run build && npm run preview
```

## Environment Variables

> [!Warning]
> In same-origin mode, video playback synchronization has high network requirements; high network latency may cause frequent forced synchronization.
> If a stable network environment cannot be guaranteed, please increase the maximum acceptable latency (at least 1 second).

- `VITE_NODE_SERVER_URL` - Your `iceServer` server list address (Refer to Cloudflare Call for API documentation)
- `VITE_MAX_ACCEPTABLE_DELAY_SECONDS` - Maximum acceptable delay time (in seconds)
- `VITE_LATENCY_MEASUREMENT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` - RTT latency measurement interval (in seconds)
- `VITE_SAME_ORIGIN_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS` - Sync interval time for video progress in same-origin mode (in seconds)
